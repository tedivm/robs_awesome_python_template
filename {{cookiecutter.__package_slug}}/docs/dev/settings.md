# Settings

This project uses the [Pydantic Base Settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/settings/) system. The `{{ cookiecutter.__package_slug }}.conf.settings:Settings` class can be expanded to include new settings. An active instance of the settings class can be found at `{{ cookiecutter.__package_slug }}.conf:settings`.
